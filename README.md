# Cloud DevOps Platform

This repository contains a production-style DevOps project designed to demonstrate end-to-end DevOps fundamentals using cloud-native and open-source tools.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to showcase how a simple application can be:
- Developed and tested locally
- Version controlled using Git and GitHub
- Containerized using Docker
- Deployed using automated CI/CD pipelines
- Provisioned using Infrastructure as Code
- Orchestrated and monitored in a cloud environment

The project is built step by step, following real-world DevOps practices.

## Technology Stack

- Python (Flask)
- Git & GitHub
- Docker
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)
- Kubernetes (AKS)
- Microsoft Azure
- Prometheus & Grafana (Monitoring)

## Current Status

- ✅ Simple Flask application running locally
- ✅ Source code versioned and pushed to GitHub

Further components such as Dockerization, CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, and Kubernetes deployment will be added incrementally.
